# Plot review for Yusu Quian

Yusu's plot explores water consumption versus the death rate from flu and pneumonia in New York City from 2007 to 2014.

### Clarity
The plot compares 2 dependent variables on the Y axis, but Yusu has clearly mentioned what they are and thus it is clear in my opinion. The quanitites being visualized are clear as Yusu has mentioned the units of measurement.

### Esthetic
The choice of colors really stand out to contrast each other clearly, and thus it is meaningful and functional. 

### Honesty
I  believe Yusu's desirable result was showing decrease in water consumption leads to increase in death rate from flu and pneumonia. However she got the opposite result, but did not shy away from plotting it, showing honest results. The data in the plot stands by as, not deformed to emphasize a point.

### Improvements
This is a very small nitpicking; the font size of the caption for the plot could be larger. Apart from this, it's very nicely done!
