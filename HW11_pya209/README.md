# PUI2018 HW 11

Worked on the assignments alone


## ASSIGNMENTS:

### Assignment 1. 
Worked on notebook. Unfortunately am unable to complete.

### Assignment 2. 
Improved on the below plot by adding the cyclic and trend components as suggested by Marvin. The code is available in 'Assignment2.ipynb'

The original plot showing the dollars per share for Apple for a period of 10 years (2006 - 2016). 


![Alt text](cyclic.png)


The cyclic component is shown in the above plot. Can see spikes from 2012. The 2008 drop is not as significant (but definitely seen). 


![Alt text](trend.png)


The trend component is shown in the above plot. It's pretty similar to the original plot.

**Note:** I have used fix_yahoo_finance library.
