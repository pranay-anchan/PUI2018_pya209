CLARITY: It’s neatly labeled and titled. 

ESTHETIC: Pranay, took a minimalist approach with this graph. Plain and simple, it tells you about Apple’s stock price. No fluffs, just pure information. I appreciate this.

HONESTY: the caption mentions about highs and lows that occurred during economic downturns, however because it’s a time series plot and that tends to contain a trend and cyclical component if not thrown in a filter, i’m quite confused how to relatively look at those highs and lows that happened during 2008 that was mentioned in the caption. You could either detrend it or talk about % changes or go for a log-linear transformation, if your goal is to pronounce highs and lows. Maybe adding in pre-2007 would also be helpful as well. Otherwise, well this a neat graph of apple's share price.
